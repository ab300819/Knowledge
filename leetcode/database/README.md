### DataBase

**175. Combine Two Tables(easy)**

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: `Address`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

`FirstName, LastName, City, State`

**solution**

```sql
SELECT
  p.FirstName,
  p.LastName,
  a.City,
  a.State
FROM Person p LEFT JOIN Address a ON p.PersonId = a.PersonId
```

**176. Second Highest Salary(easy)**

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

**solution**

```sql
SELECT (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) SecondHighestSalary
```

**183. Customers Who Never Order(easy)**

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: `Orders`.

```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

**solution**

```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId
                   FROM Orders)
```

**595. Big Countries(easy)**

There is a table `World`

```
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| name            | continent  | area       | population   | gdp           |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| Afghanistan     | Asia       | 652230     | 25500100     | 20343000      |
| Albania         | Europe     | 28748      | 2831741      | 12960000      |
| Algeria         | Africa     | 2381741    | 37100000     | 188681000     |
| Andorra         | Europe     | 468        | 78115        | 3712000       |
| Angola          | Africa     | 1246700    | 20609294     | 100990000     |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:

```
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
```

**solution**

```sql
SELECT
  anem,
  population,
  area WHERE max(length( NAME )) OR max(population) OR max(area) FROM World
```

**596. Classes More Than 5 Students**

There is a table `courses` with columns: **student and **class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```

Should output:

```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```

**solution**

```sql
SELECT
  class,
  COUNT(DISTINCT student)
FROM
  courses
GROUP BY class;
```

**620. Not Boring Movies**

X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.

Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

For example, table `cinema`:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

For the example above, the output should be:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

**solution**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM cinema
WHERE mod(id, 2) != 0 AND description NOT LIKE '%boring%'
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

**627. Swap Salary**

Given a table `salary`, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.

For example:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```

After running your query, the above salary table should have the following rows:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```

**solution**

```sql
UPDATE salary
SET
  sex = CASE sex
        WHEN 'm'
          THEN 'f'
        ELSE 'm'
        END;
```
